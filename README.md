# oppsql
This package provides tooling for interacting with OMNeT++'s SQLite result files.
It contains a script for merging individual result databases, and a small python library to access the data.
Note that this repository is currently only contains a few helpers I wrote and is thus only used by me.
Therefore it, likely contains bugs and is not stable.
